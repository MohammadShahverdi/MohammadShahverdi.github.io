I am currently a PhD student in the College of Management of Technology at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/schools/cdm/). I work on causality and related fields under the supervision of [Prof. Negar Kiyavash](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7tBDvOwAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). Before that, I was a bachelor's student in computer science at Sharif University of Technology(2018-2023).
