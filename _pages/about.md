I am currently pursuing my PhD at the College of Management of Technology at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/schools/cdm/), under the supervision of [Prof. Negar Kiyavash](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7tBDvOwAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). My research focuses on multi-armed bandit problems, particularly in pure exploration settings, with additional interests in causal inference. Prior to this, I completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Sharif University of Technology (2018-2023).
